Hybrid Web + Desktop Application

This project is a hybrid application developed as part of an internship screening task.
It allows users to upload a CSV file containing chemical equipment parameters and visualize analytical summaries via both Web and Desktop interfaces using a common Django REST backend.

🚀 Features

1. Upload CSV files containing chemical equipment data
2. Backend parses data and computes:
3. Total equipment count
4. Average flowrate
5. Average pressure
6. Average temperature
7. Equipment type distribution
8. Web-based visualization using React + Chart.js
9. Desktop-based visualization using PyQt5 + Matplotlib
10. Common REST API shared by Web and Desktop apps
11. Stores recent upload summaries (SQLite)
12. Clean modular architecture
